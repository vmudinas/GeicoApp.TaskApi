## Honoroble mentions of what fell out of scope or was not implemented fully.

1. Authorization, authentication out of scope.
2. Broader unit test coverage desirable.
3.CI/CD out of scope
4. Api end point that return all (was not required by assigment but added to make testing easier)
Future development I would add paginng for pulling data.
