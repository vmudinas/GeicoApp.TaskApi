## Honorable mentions of what fell out of scope or was not implemented fully.

1. Authorization, authentication out of scope.
2. Broader unit test coverage desirable.
3.CI/CD out of scope
4. Api endpoint that return all (was not required by assigment but added to make testing easier)
5. Future development I would add paging for pulling data.
